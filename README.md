# Goal-Prediction-ML-project
Football being the worlds most popular sport the money involved in player transfers are
huge. Especially when talking about strikers. That is why it is important to see how a striker
performs during a season before a team will decide if they want to buy that striker or not. And
the main way to see that is through how many goals he makes. So the goal of this project is to
predict the number of goals a striker will score during one season based of the strikerâ€™s shooting
statistics.\
